    the requests library's post method.

    Args:
        sender_email: str. The email address of the sender. This should be in
            the form 'SENDER_NAME <SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS>' or
            'SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS'. Must be utf-8.
        recipient_emails: list(str). The email addresses of the recipients.
            Must be utf-8.
        subject: str. The subject line of the email, Must be utf-8.
        plaintext_body: str. The plaintext body of the email. Must be utf-8.
        html_body: str. The HTML body of the email. Must fit in a datastore
            entity. Must be utf-8.
        bcc: list(str)|None. Optional argument. List of bcc emails.
        reply_to: str|None. Optional argument. Reply address formatted like
            â€œreply+<reply_id>@<incoming_email_domain_name>
            reply_id is the unique id of the sender.
        recipient_variables: dict|None. Optional argument. If batch sending
            requires differentiating each email based on the recipient, we
            assign a unique id to each recipient, including info relevant to
            that recipient so that we can reference it when composing the
            email like so:

                    {"bob@example.com": {"first":"Bob", "id":1},
                     "alice@example.com": {"first":"Alice", "id":2}}
                subject = 'Hey, %recipient.first%'
            More info about this format at:
                https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/user_manual.html
                #batch-sending.
        attachments: list(dict)|None. Optional argument. A list of
            dictionaries, where each dictionary includes the keys `filename`
            and `path` with their corresponding values.

    Raises:
        Exception. The mailgun api key is not stored in
            feconf.MAILGUN_API_KEY.
